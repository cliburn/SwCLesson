This lesson demonstrates how to put several lessons that might be learnt in a Python bootcamp together in a mini-capstone example of *data munging*.

### Objective

Beginners typically learn the usage of Python language constructs in isolation, which is good since it avoids mental overload. However, once you have learnt the basics, it is essential to see practical examples of how Python constructs are integrated to solve real-world problems. This session shows how to integrate several basic Python constructs to solve a text processing problem.

**Task**: Count the number of each word (ignoring case) in the Gettysburg address (in the file "getty.txt"), and print the top 10 words.

### Skills:

* reading text files
* basic text clean-up operations
* usage of set, list and dictionary
* sorting with optional arguments
* usage of list and dictionary comprehensions
* usage of the string and operator modules
